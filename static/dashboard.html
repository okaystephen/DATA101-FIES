          On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
          by the
          charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
          bound to
          ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
          saying
          through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
          hour, when our
          power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
          pleasure is to
          be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
          obligations of
          business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
          therefore
          always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
          pleasures, or
          else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
